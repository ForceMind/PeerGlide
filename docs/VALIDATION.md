| platform clippy/check, x86_64-pc-windows-gnu | Passed (cross compile; no desktop run) |
| platform clippy/check, aarch64-apple-darwin | Passed (cross compile; no desktop run) |
| Initial native Windows/macOS/Linux GitHub CI | Passed: run 39729892588, commit 0fa2316; fmt, clippy, tests, release/link and artifacts on all three OSes |
| Real Windows ↔ macOS with Bluetooth/USB | Not run: no physical desktop sessions available |

Pending physical checks: all four edges and return; held keys/buttons; Ctrl/Alt/
Command mappings; simultaneous local input; IME layouts; 100–200% Windows scaling
and macOS Retina; permission denial; Secure Input; elevated windows; fullscreen;
packet loss/jitter; process/network failure while dragging or holding modifiers;
sleep/wake. Full topology, numpad/media/OEM key coverage, native drag, clipboard,
files, full GUI/tray, discovery, auto-reconnect, signing and installers remain incomplete.

Cross compilation proves source typechecking only. Native CI proves compilation,
linking and noninteractive tests only. Neither proves physical desktop behavior.

Second implementation adds GUI headless page rendering in both themes, enrollment
confirmation/pinning tests, stream-size and wrong-server rejection, graceful
GUI worker stop and native modifier/hotkey mapping tests. Two real CLI processes
passed authentication/probe/clean-exit smoke locally. Current cloud container
blocks display sockets, so native GUI-window smoke and screenshots run only on
the isolated Linux CI runner. Windows/macOS desktop interaction remains untested.

License metadata is screened with allowed SPDX alternatives (including MIT
instead of optional LGPL choices). Bundles collect upstream notices and include
published-source fallbacks for archives lacking separate license files. This is
not a completed legal audit; inspect those notices before a stable release.

Expanded CI caught a Linux GUI runtime dependency missing from the runner
(`libxkbcommon-x11`). The workflow now installs the documented X11/EGL/Mesa
runtime libraries before launching its virtual display. The correction is being
verified on the final PR head; the failed checkpoint is not counted as passing.
Protocol v2 adds reliable cursor anchors for discrete input and first-motion
edge return, with dedicated loss/replay and real-session return tests.


## Recovery hardening follow-up

Pending-release fault tests cover transient injector failure, permanent failure
with a bounded three-attempt flush, retention for final cleanup, and continued
release of other inputs when one release fails. Session recovery now propagates
cleanup failure and stops the session; Drop performs another bounded cleanup
attempt and reports incomplete cleanup without logging key contents.

Windows wheel deltas now retain sub-detent remainder independently on each axis.
A regression test covers accumulation, direction reversal and multi-detent input.
These tests do not prove OS acceptance: persistent OS rejection or process death
can still prevent synthetic release. Physical acceptance remains issue #3.


## Ordered return regression (protocol v3)

A live QUIC regression sends an edge datagram before deliberately delayed reliable
button input. The v2 implementation fails: it immediately sends Release instead
of retaining the lease. In v3, the edge datagram does not revoke the lease; delayed
input and heartbeat remain valid, and a subsequent reliable Release allows a new
lease. Source boundary tests cover all four edges and immediate reverse motion.

Local workspace tests (22 Linux tests), strict clippy and fmt passed. Real OS
input acceptance remains pending. Updating one peer alone is unsupported; v3 ALPN
intentionally rejects v2. Safety timeout and local preemption are still allowed
to interrupt input without draining it.


## C01: fixture isolation investigation (2026-11-02)

Historical main run 41226383167 failed only the macOS GUI render test with an
uncontextualized os error 2. Runs 41321441089 and 41321555098 passed without a
runtime fix; neither proves the race cause. PR #14's initial run 41324173162
failed rustfmt on all platforms, before any test executed.

Follow-up reserves each fixture with exclusive create_dir, adds per-process
sequence names, RAII fallback cleanup, explicit contextual cleanup errors and a
32-thread fixture ownership/cleanup regression. macOS CI executes the render
test alone, then all GUI tests 20 times with eight test threads, recording OS and
compiler. No test is skipped and failed tests are not retried to mask a failure.
Only fixture-name reservation retries AlreadyExists, never test execution.

The historical timestamp collision remains a hypothesis: the original log did
not identify the failed I/O operation or preserve allocated paths. A green final
matrix and stress run demonstrate the new fixture behavior, not proof of the
original failure's root cause. Issue #10 remains open pending that evidence.
Physical Windows/macOS input acceptance #3 is unaffected.


C01 fixture candidate `3260af9b26cea2c0696c6341ef5c4050cdf84f02` passed complete
Windows/macOS/Linux CI run 41324690497, including the isolated macOS test and all
20 parallel iterations; merged via #14. Historical root cause remains open #10.
C02 first slice `bbb34d8acf85fc07e4475db8a1967114ab6de745` passed native matrix
41324857672 and merged via #15. See INPUT_COMPATIBILITY.md for remaining C02 gaps.

## C03: cooperative capture ownership

CaptureSession now has explicit shutdown; source suppression is disabled before
bounded join. A process-wide reservation survives timed-out owners until the
native thread really exits, preventing overlapping hooks. Windows message waits
and macOS run-loop slices bound idle shutdown checks to 50ms; cleanup unhooks or
disables/releases the native tap before reporting completion.

Local workspace tests, strict clippy, Windows/macOS target clippy including tests,
Debug build and two-process QUIC/graceful-stop smoke passed. Lifecycle tests use
fake loops: repeated joins, partial initialization exit, bounded timeout/recovery;
native platforms additionally test exclusive reservations. Real native thread and
handle counts/repeated permission-granted capture remain unverified. C03 remains
implemented-unverified for those gates. See CAPTURE_LIFECYCLE.md. C04 structured
worker events and C05 final-pointer/recovery regression expansion remain pending.


## Subsequent C03/C04 validation and C05 boundary regressions

C03 candidate `fd1948eb1c8c9cc2736b9f1c87108269e13f7fd4` passed full native
matrix 41325579471 and merged via #16. C04 candidate
`193c067aef49ef7f36dc4376771b99993784f4dd` passed native matrix 41325829626 and
merged via #17. Earlier statements that C04 was pending describe the C03
checkpoint, not current implementation. The integrated main dbef1d3eecb9d4a1cd21771650cdf8172766f956
passed local 29-test workspace/clippy and managed two-process smoke.

C05 now adds exact-deadline tests: heartbeat and cursor anchors cannot revive an
expired lease, pressed modifiers/buttons still produce balanced cleanup, repeated
cleanup is empty, and delayed old-lease reliable/datagram events cannot contaminate
a new lease. Final-pointer delivery and full fault/session regression expansion
remain pending; these tests do not claim those capabilities or physical acceptance.


C03 bounded-join follow-up: a completion notification can precede blocked TLS
cleanup. The new regression failed before the fix (shutdown returned success
only after rescue released the destructor despite a zero budget). The first is_finished-based fix also failed all three platforms in run
41327242373; it was not merged. A dedicated reaper now owns join and the capture
reservation through all thread-local destruction. The caller waits only on a
bounded acknowledgement, so timeout never enters join on the caller thread. This does not establish real OS handle-count acceptance.


## C02 physical scan / keypad slice

Adds physical Windows scan capture/injection with E0 flags, distinct keypad Enter
and navigation keys, startup VK sample replacement, and macOS keypad/ISO mappings.
Local workspace tests/strict clippy plus native-target platform clippy passed.
Native CI and Apple SDK constant verification are required on the final candidate.
Real keypad, NumLock/layout/IME and mixed-keyboard behavior remain #3 acceptance;
C02 is still implementing, with media/full OEM/capability work pending.


## C05 terminal cursor / protocol v4

Protocol v4 carries a final cursor in normal reliable Release. Tests cover total
motion loss, invalid/foreign/expired anchors, pointer failure with balanced key
cleanup, retained injector failures, late/duplicate leases, wire roundtrip, real
session release and v3 ALPN rejection. Safety interruption does not require an
anchor. Local workspace tests (39 Linux), strict clippy, Debug build and managed
smoke passed; native matrix and physical dragging/DPI/fault acceptance remain
separate. See ADR-0003 for the mandatory two-peer upgrade and unchanged trust.
C02 physical-key candidate 84d06d2b05a19ccba2171881c4108700da435a1a passed all three
platforms plus active Apple SDK constants in run 41329928375, merged via #19.
