# Validation record

2026-10-22, isolated cloud Linux development environment. No user Mac/PC changes.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| cargo test --workspace | Initial 8 tests passed; expanded session/GUI/security suite recorded in CI: framing, lease authorization/conflict/replay/expiry, pressed release, edge gate, authenticated QUIC/datagrams and untrusted-client rejection |
| cargo fmt --all; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings | Passed |
| platform clippy/check, x86_64-pc-windows-gnu | Passed (cross compile; no desktop run) |
| platform clippy/check, aarch64-apple-darwin | Passed (cross compile; no desktop run) |
| Initial native Windows/macOS/Linux GitHub CI | Passed: run 39729892588, commit 0fa2316; fmt, clippy, tests, release/link and artifacts on all three OSes |
| Real Windows ↔ macOS with Bluetooth/USB | Not run: no physical desktop sessions available |

Pending physical checks: all four edges and return; held keys/buttons; Ctrl/Alt/
Command mappings; simultaneous local input; IME layouts; 100–200% Windows scaling
and macOS Retina; permission denial; Secure Input; elevated windows; fullscreen;
packet loss/jitter; process/network failure while dragging or holding modifiers;
sleep/wake. Full topology, numpad/media/OEM key coverage, native drag, clipboard,
files, full GUI/tray, discovery, auto-reconnect, signing and installers remain incomplete.

Cross compilation proves source typechecking only. Native CI proves compilation,
linking and noninteractive tests only. Neither proves physical desktop behavior.

Second implementation adds GUI headless page rendering in both themes, enrollment
confirmation/pinning tests, stream-size and wrong-server rejection, graceful
GUI worker stop and native modifier/hotkey mapping tests. Two real CLI processes
passed authentication/probe/clean-exit smoke locally. Current cloud container
blocks display sockets, so native GUI-window smoke and screenshots run only on
the isolated Linux CI runner. Windows/macOS desktop interaction remains untested.

License metadata is screened with allowed SPDX alternatives (including MIT
instead of optional LGPL choices). Bundles collect upstream notices and include
published-source fallbacks for archives lacking separate license files. This is
not a completed legal audit; inspect those notices before a stable release.

Expanded CI caught a Linux GUI runtime dependency missing from the runner
(`libxkbcommon-x11`). The workflow now installs the documented X11/EGL/Mesa
runtime libraries before launching its virtual display. The correction is being
verified on the final PR head; the failed checkpoint is not counted as passing.
Protocol v2 adds reliable cursor anchors for discrete input and first-motion
edge return, with dedicated loss/replay and real-session return tests.
