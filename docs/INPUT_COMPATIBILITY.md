# Input compatibility and C02 status

C02 is implementing, not accepted. The current finite HID map does not imply
complete OEM/numpad/media/IME support. Unknown physical key events cancel the
current control/switch intent, immediately disable local suppression and pass
through locally. A payload-free diagnostic explains that no forwarding occurred.
Remote pressed inputs are released through existing session recovery. Unknown
keys are tracked separately from HID usages and block acquisition while held;
startup sampling includes unknown keys in the sampled OS keycode ranges.

This is a safe fallback, not remote support for those keys. Consumer/media events
not delivered through the existing native keyboard callbacks remain outside this
coverage. Full extended-key mapping, capability negotiation, keyboard layouts and
physical Windows/macOS acceptance are still pending under C02/#3. No wire or
permission change is introduced. Protocol v3 normal-return ordering is unchanged.

Native hook tests cover cancellation, held-key guard, autorepeat, no raw input
forwarding, armed-toggle cancellation and bounded-queue fail-open behavior.
Cross compilation is only typechecking; platform CI and real hardware acceptance
are separate gates. C03 thread shutdown and C04 structured events remain pending.


## Physical scan and keypad follow-up

Windows capture now maps set-1 scan positions plus E0, rather than layout-dependent
virtual letters. Injection uses KEYEVENTF_SCANCODE and the matching extended/up
flags. Main/keypad Enter, navigation/keypad digits, and left/right modifiers stay
distinct. Startup VK samples use their own namespace so keypad Enter release can
clear a previously ambiguous VK_RETURN sample without leaving acquisition stuck.
This does not establish per-device state for two physical keyboards holding the
same key; real hardware acceptance remains required.

Both backends add HID keypad digits/operators/decimal/Enter and ISO backslash.
Num Lock/Clear is the physical HID position, not a promise of identical toggle
semantics between operating systems. Text comes from the target layout/IME;
physical forwarding is not Unicode text translation. Media, Pause/PrintScreen,
full OEM coverage and explicit peer capability negotiation remain pending. Older
backends may reject new keypad usages and stop safely; update both peers to use
the extended map. Network protocol v3 is unchanged by this mapping slice.

Windows tests check physical scan round trips, down/up flags, E0 distinctions and
startup keypad release. macOS CI verifies the new constants against the active
Apple SDK Events.h, independently of the Rust round-trip test. These are compile,
SDK and logic checks, not desktop input acceptance.
